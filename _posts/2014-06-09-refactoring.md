today i leraned sth about refactoring.

extract method

Refactoring is like continuing repair of a living
system. The goal is to stay within reasonable
operating limits with limited continual damage.
By staying within these limits you keep costs
low, because costs relate nonlinearly to the
amount of repair necessary. It is like maintaining
your house. You are best off (financially) if you
continuously maintain rather than do large lump
repairs.
